The Specification


GYST is an application for keeping track of the entire needs & inventory of your home. Different categories of needs (food, household items, toiletry, etc.) can be kept track of in terms of expiry dates, quantity left, etc. There are 3 different user types: single, multiple, and organization.  There are two main lists of items defined. One of them is the list of needs of the user that will eventually make it to the list of inventory after its purchase. The second list of items is the list of items in the inventory of the user. Each item in the inventory will have attributes expiry date (if applicable), and the quantity left. In the beginning, the list of items in the cycle of needs will be initialized by the user either by logging items one by one to the shopping list/list of needs. The user will be warned if the expiry date of an item in the inventory is close to its current date or if the quantity left is close to zero by a predefined rate of difference. Additional purchases can be added by the user while there is the specified item already existing in the inventory. In this case, the number of items bought before the recent purchase will still count as “to be expired” if applicable.
