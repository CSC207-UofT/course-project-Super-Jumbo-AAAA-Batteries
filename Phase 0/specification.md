### The Specification
gyst is a command-line interface that manages your household inventory. Different categories of needs (food and household items) can be kept track of in terms of expiry dates (if applicable) and quantity. There are two main lists of items defined. First, we have the list of needs (shopping list) of the user. An item in this list will be moved into the inventory list when purchased. The second list of items is the inventory of the user. Each item in the inventory will have attributes such as expiry date (if applicable), and the quantity. In the beginning, the list of needed items will be initialized, and the user can add items to that list by logging items one by one. The user will be warned when the expiry date of an item in the inventory is close to the current date or if the quantity of an item is close to zero by a specified margin. Additional purchases of an item can be added by the user even if that item already exists in the inventory. In this case, identical items will be handled in batches based on their expiry date.
